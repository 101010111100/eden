<h3>I. Quick Start</h3>

<p>To get started on this amazing adventure start by heading over to the <a href="/download">downloads</a> page and getting the core files. You'll notice when downloading, it's only one file. We made it easier to try out <strong>Eden</strong> by compressing and bundling the whole library in one file.</p>

<p>From here just upload that file to your server <em>(under the assumption you have access to a server with at least PHP5.2.6)</em>, create a new file called <sub>test.php</sub> in the same directory you uploaded <sub>eden.php</sub> and paste the code snippet below.</p>

<sub>Paste this Code Snippet!</sub>
<div class="example"><pre class="brush: php;">
include('eden.php');
eden()->Eden_Tool()->output('Hello World'); //--> Hello World
</pre></div>

<p>If you look at <sub>test.php</sub> in your browser you'll see something along the lines of <strong>&quot;Hello World&quot;</strong>. This means you are ready to build a website! As easy as it is to install, head over to the section called <a href="/documentation/library">II. The Library</a> to find out how easy <strong>Eden</strong> is to learn.</p>
